Hello and welcome to "Sendiptoemail".

This python script will allow you to regularly send the ip of your current machine to an email address.

To start, an account needs to be created, from which emails will be sent, I highly recommend creating a new gmail account (the account will be less secure).

Then go to account settings -> privacy -> let secure apps access , and turn it on (see screenshots in the Instructions folder).

run "setup.py" and input all the needed information.

when finished, run "run.py".





* Libraries used: smtplib, ssl, requests, datetime, os, time
* Logs will be saved locally
For any real python developers, I would really love any sort of feedback. I welcome suggestions and bugs, if you find any problem or have a better way of writing certain parts, please feel free to send.
